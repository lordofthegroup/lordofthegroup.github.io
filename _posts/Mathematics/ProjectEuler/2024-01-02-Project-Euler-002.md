Project Euler 002

Problem description:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

$$1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,\dots $$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Solution:

The parity of the Fibonacci sequence has a pattern, odd, even, odd, odd, even, odd. There's one even number in the middle of every three numbers in the sequence. I in fact didn't write any codes for this problem. A quick WolframAlpha estimate showed that the largest Fibonacci number such that $Fibonacci(k) \leqslant 4000000$ appears when $k = 38$, which is the 37-th term in the above sequence because the Fibonacci function has an index shift in WolframAlpha. So the problem becomes to evaluate $\sum_{k = 0}^{12}Fibonacci(3k+2)$.
